# Welcome to my work on human activity classification, this work is based on the work by this paper: 

## I have spent two years give or take researching on this topic and the findings are honestly incredible. Aside from the direct findings of this paper in particular, the fact that you can classify what someone or something is doing by just using 3-6 sensors on connected device is astonishing and not as well known as it should be.
