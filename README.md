# Human Activity Classification Resarch and findings 

The work presented here is about two years worth, a culmination researching on this topic and the findings are honestly incredible. Aside from the direct findings of this paper in particular, the fact that you can classify what someone or something is doing by just using 3-6 sensors on connected device is astonishing and not as well known as it should be.
